    // 1. Add a main method.
    // 2. Declare several variables of various types to be "plugged in" to a Mad Libs sentence.
    // 3. Use string concatenation to build a silly sentence.
    // 4. Print the result.
    // 5. Change variable values to change the sentence. Ask a friend for random values to increase the chances
    // of something hilarious or kinda naughty.
